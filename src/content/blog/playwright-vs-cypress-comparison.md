# Playwright vs Cypress: A Practical Comparison

As someone who has implemented both Playwright and Cypress in production environments, I'm often asked: "Which testing framework should I choose?" The answer, as with most things in software, is "it depends."

## Quick Overview

| Feature | Playwright | Cypress |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Browser Support** | Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge | Chrome, Firefox, Edge |
| **Language Support** | JS/TS, Python, C#, Java | JavaScript/TypeScript only |
| **Parallel Execution** | Built-in | Paid plan required |
| **Network Interception** | Full control | Limited to XHR/Fetch |
| **Mobile Testing** | Yes (device emulation) | Limited |

## When to Choose Playwright

### Multi-Browser Testing is Critical
```typescript
// Easy cross-browser testing
test.describe('Cross-browser tests', () => {
  ['chromium', 'firefox', 'webkit'].forEach(browserName => {
    test(`Login flow on ${browserName}`, async ({ page }) => {
      // Your test code
    });
  });
});
```

### You Need True Parallel Execution
Playwright's built-in parallelization can dramatically reduce test execution time without additional licensing costs.

### Network-Level Testing is Required
```typescript
// Intercept and modify network requests
await page.route('**/api/users', route => {
  route.fulfill({
    status: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ users: mockUsers })
  });
});
```

## When to Choose Cypress

### Developer Experience is Priority #1
Cypress's time-travel debugging and real-time browser view make debugging tests a breeze.

### Your Team is JavaScript-Focused
If your entire team works in JavaScript/TypeScript, Cypress's single-language approach might be preferable.

### You Need Mature Ecosystem
Cypress has been around longer and has a more established plugin ecosystem.

## Real-World Performance Comparison

In my recent project migrating from Cypress to Playwright:

- **Test execution time**: 40% faster with Playwright (parallel execution)
- **Flaky test reduction**: 60% fewer flaky tests with Playwright's auto-waiting
- **Setup complexity**: Cypress was easier to get started, Playwright required more initial configuration

## The Verdict

For **new projects** where you need robust, fast testing across multiple browsers, **Playwright** is often the better choice.

For **existing JavaScript teams** who prioritize developer experience and don't need extensive cross-browser coverage, **Cypress** remains excellent.

## Migration Tips

If you're considering migration from Cypress to Playwright:

1. **Start small**: Migrate one test suite at a time
2. **Leverage similarities**: Both use similar async/await patterns
3. **Update selectors**: Playwright's locator strategy is more robust
4. **Rethink waits**: Playwright's auto-waiting reduces explicit wait needs
